General issues:

1) Use UINT16 in all possible cases?
     Note: Dave F says that TI uses 16-bit as smallest addressable size
     Note: RAM available in smallest processor not known yet
     Note: Serialization does not mandate same image as memory; ref CBOR as a IO redux method

2) If UINT8 used, pad Aux to UINT16?

3) Move Packet_ID_Seq to header instead of footer?

4) Need LRU_ID enumeration

5) Word16_Count to exclude header?
     Opinion: good idea to include header to make generic 'skip message' processing available.

6) Why 'Header_CRC'?  Doesn't include the whole message body minus the CRC field itself?
     Also: what is the CRC polynomial to use?

7) Can the max number of concurrent messages be determined for this system?
     i.e. Is this a valid approach to deal with static memory allocation?








T_Set_LCAS_Command_Message (51) - Dynamic count, range == [(0), (41)]
	* Has 41 defined LCAS message types, so 41 may be the implied MAX


T_Set_Event_Text_Command_Message (53) - Dynamic count, range == [0,4]


T_Update_Window_Command_Message (55) - Dynamic array of STRUCT, missing range on counter
	STRUCT contains [possible!] dynamic count of CHAR

        * This is a central GUI control message

	* Recommend split several messages; this design packs all possible widget control into a single 
          message of VARIANT-level complexity


T_Add_Pallet_Command_Message (58) - Dynamic array of STRUCT, range == [1,7]

T_Add_Platform_Command_Message (59) - Dynamic array of STRUCT, range == [1,7]

T_Add_CDS_Command_Message (59) - Dynamic array of STRUCT, range == [1,20]
	The Bundle data struct has issues: a value exceeds 16-bit range, and there is an overly complicated Enum

T_Add_Logistics_Command_Message (61) - Dynamic array of STRUCT, range == [1,32]
	The Logistics data struct has issues: there is an overly complicated Enum

T_Delete_Cargo_Command_Message (62) - Dynamic array of UINT16, range == [1,(32)]
        The MAX is missing, but Logistics is biggest and allows 32 max

T_Set_Lock_Icons_Command_Message (65) - Dynamic array of STRUCT, range == [1,16]

T_Set_CRG_Icons_Command_Message (66) - Dynamic array of STRUCT, range == [1,16]

T_Highlight_Cargo_Command_Message (70) - Dynamic array of STRUCT, range == [0,64]

T_Highlight_Event_Command_Message (71) - Dynamic array of STRUCT, range == [0,16]

T_Add_Event_Command_Message (72) - Dynamic array of UINT16, range == [0,32]

T_Delete_Event_Command_Message (73) - Dynamic array of UINT16, range == [0,32]

T_Event_Data_Periodic_Message  (86) - VARIANT_ARRAY, range == [0,16]
	Some VARIANT_ITEMs include dynamic array of UINT16

T_Cargo_Periodic_Message (87) - Multiple dynamic array of STRUCT, some ranges missing

T_Release_Force_Periodic_Message (88) - Dynamic array of STRUCT, range == [0,24]

T_Monitor_BIT_Response_Message (105) - Dynamic array of STRUCT, range == missing

T_Monitor_Status_Periodic_Message (107) - Fixed array of STRUCT [#32]

T_Mission_Parameter_Command_Message (108) - VARIANT_ITEM

T_SOFTWARE_FIELD_LOAD_Message (250) - VARIANT_ARRAY

T_Maintenance_Data_ARINC_Periodic_Message (201) - Dynamic array of STRUCT (32-bit word), range == missing
